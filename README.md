Once sleepiness is detected, the app plays sounds that wakes the driver up. 

NOTE: Even if the driver wake up the playing sound does not stop immediately, app still keeps playing and stops about 10-20 seconds later in order to make sure that the driver is completely awake.

While detection is running, if you want to save phone battery life, click on the "Eco mode" button and detection continues running in the background.
